# Smart-Parking-Management-Arduino
This project is an Arduino-based Smart Parking System that automatically controls the entry and exit gate using IR sensors and a servo motor. It displays the number of available parking slots on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen in real-time, helping users quickly know parking availability and reducing manual monitoring.
